# incus Builder

Type: `incus`
Artifact BuilderId: `incus`

The `incus` Packer builder builds containers for incus. The builder starts an incus
container, runs provisioners within this container, then saves the container as
an incus image.

The incus builder requires a modern linux kernel and the `incus` package. This
builder does not work with LXC.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example.

**HCL**

```hcl
source "incus" "incus-xenial" {
  image = "ubuntu-daily:xenial"
  output_image = "ubuntu-xenial"
  publish_properties {
    description = "Trivial repackage with Packer"
  }
}

build {
  sources = ["incus.incus-xenial"]
}
```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "incus",
      "name": "incus-xenial",
      "image": "ubuntu-daily:xenial",
      "output_image": "ubuntu-xenial",
      "publish_properties": {
        "description": "Trivial repackage with Packer"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

@include 'builder/incus/Config-required.mdx'

  ~> Note: The builder may appear to pause if required to download a
  remote image, as they are usually 100-200MB. `/var/log/incus/incus.log` will
  mention starting such downloads.

### Optional:

@include 'builder/incus/Config-not-required.mdx'
